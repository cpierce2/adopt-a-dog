Adopt-a-Dog Website (AAD)

This site was made for the University of Washington Front-End-Development Certificate course as a project for HTML 200.
It is a mock site for adopting a pet dog with different dog options. The site also allows for a contact form to be submitted.
On the Blog page, it shows three different articles with links to the blog on the index page (for larger viewport devices).

AAD contains 4 HTML pages:
    - Home (index.html)
    - Dogs (dogs.html)
    - Blog (blog.html)
    - Contact (contact.html)

The site used Javascript. The Blog page is dynamically created using Javascript and JQuery for effect.
